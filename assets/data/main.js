Your image will be printed on one of our popular photo papers (satin luster or metallic pearl) and face mounted to the back of the ¼” acrylic panels with a polished edge. In addition to the two paper choices you can choose from either a high gloss polished shine (most popular) or a reflection control acrylic. You can also opt to have your acrylic ordered with a dibond backing. Hanging hardware is provided at no additional charge.',
